# MapBBCode Extension for PunBB

Adds [map] bbcode to a board. Tested with PunBB 1.3, 1.3.4, 1.4.2. To install, just unpack `dist/mapbbcode_punbb.zip` to `%PUNBB%/extensions` and install the extension from administrator's menu.

To add proprietary layers (Google, Yandex etc.) you would have to install mapbbcode_proprietary extension. To do that, copy `manifest_proprietary.xml` to `%PUNBB%/extensions/mapbbcode_proprietary/manifest.xml`, creating the directory, and install the extension from administrator's panel.
